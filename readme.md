A [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) provider to manage [Lyve Cloud Storage](https://www.seagate.com/gb/en/services/cloud/storage/). \
This project is based on the official [AWS provider](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws).

## Requirements

* [`Go 1.19`](https://go.dev/doc/install) (to build the provider plugin)
* [`Terraform v1.2`](https://www.terraform.io/downloads)

## Usage

### Configure
To quickly get started using the provider, configure the provider as shown below.

You can set the credentials of the S3 API to manage buckets and objects, the credentials of the Account API to manage permissions and service accounts, or both.

```hcl
provider "lyvecloud" {
  //s3 api - optional
  region = ""
  access_key = ""
  secret_key = ""
  endpoint_url = ""

  //account api - optional
  client_id = ""
  client_secret = ""
}
```


### Create bucket example

```hcl
resource "lyvecloud_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  bucket = "my-tf-bucket"
}
```

### Create permission example

```hcl
resource "lyvecloud_permission" "permission" {
  name = "my-tf-permission"
  description = "my-example-permission-description"
  actions = "all-operations" // “all-operations”, “read”, or “write”.
  buckets = ["my-tf-bucket"]
}
```

For full provider documentation with details on all options available, see [docs](./docs/) folder.

## Development
For development purposes, the provider needs to be built locally.

Clone this repository, and [install Task](https://taskfile.dev/installation/):
```sh
go install github.com/go-task/task/v3/cmd/task@latest
```
**Note:** for more installation options of [Task](https://taskfile.dev/), please view Task [installation guide](https://taskfile.dev/installation/).

Run the following command to build and install the plugin in the correct folder (resolved automatically based on the OS):
```sh
task install
```

To to use the built-in plugin, use the following configurations:
```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    lyvecloud = {
      source  = "registry.terraform.io/seagate/lyvecloud"
    }
  }
}

provider "lyvecloud" {
  //s3 api - optional
  region = ""
  access_key = ""
  secret_key = ""
  endpoint_url = ""

  //account api - optional
  client_id = ""
  client_secret = ""
}
```
